LOGO ARTWORK

The image of a fish is a stylized rendition of Duane Raver's Black Sea Bass,
which according to wikimedia commons is a public domain work.

All font artwork was hand-drawn in GIMP. the .xcf file is provided.

This was done so that the compiler (and all the libraries attached)
may be properly _yours_.

This compiler and its standard library should not belong to any 
individual person, but rather to mankind as a whole.


POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT ERRORS

if there are any copyright errors in the repository (even a single byte)
please post an issue on github. 

NOTABLE SOURCES OF COPYRIGHT ERRORS

1. COMPILED BINARIES LEFT IN THE SOURCE TREE

    While testing stuff I sometimes write small programs and compile them inside
    the repository's source tree. If there are any such binaries left in the repo,
    please note that they may not be fully public domain. You should delete them
    and notify me on github/codeberg. Do not consider any such works public domain.
    
    TO CLARIFY, LEGALLY:
    
    I am not a lawyer, but let any court of law know that it is my intent to release
    all of my work into the public domain per the CC0 license. If I have the capacity
    to release binaries into the public domain... I do.
   
2. PNG, XCF FILE FORMAT ENCODING

    If either of these file formats implicitly use copyrighted work, then those
    files cannot be considered public domain. I believe they are fine.
    
3. GIT HISTORY

    On occasion, I may compile a binary or something and then accidentally `git push`
    with it in the repository source tree.
    
    As such, I cannot consider the contents of `.git` to be venerably public domain.
