CBAS IS AN AWESOME TOOL. HOW DO I MAKE A SPLASH WITH IT?

I'm sitting on diamonds-in-the-rough. Unfortunately, most people
want POLISHED diamonds...

I figure, roughly in order of importance:

1. I need a reference for the language and the tool. Lists of every builtin function,
every keyword, etcetera. I need to document the standard metaprogramming library's
capabilities. I need examples in the reference that can be pasted and compiled.

2. I need a manual or "programmer's guide" for teaching the language. It should
be a PDF.

3. I need a logo/symbol for the project. Since it's called "Coder's Basilisk" now,
I figure it should be like a snake curled up around an exploding star or a black hole
or something.

4. I need programs written in CBAS which showcase its usefulness.

5. I need videos which showcase programs written in cbas.

6. I need a devkit setup. For Linux, I pretty much already have that. But for Windows
(Which is what everyone uses...) we pretty much don't. Compilation on Windows is tough cookies.

I could bundle TinyCC or something with it. I don't know.
