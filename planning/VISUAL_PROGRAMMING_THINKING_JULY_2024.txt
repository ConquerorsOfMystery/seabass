My comment on scopes:

All programming is done as one or more semi-linear sequences of instructions, each of which references variables either A) in global state B) in the local context of the stack C) in an object

You can genericize the global-context-object system into "abstract scopes" with a set of namespaces attached to them.
Methods are just functions with a particular class's local variables included specially in their namespace.
Scopes are just objects on the stack
the set of variables that comprise the data in a particular scope comprise an anonymous class

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm thinking that if I define a fairly flexible object-oriented language around the concept of "abstract scopes"
then I could make a graphical programming language that could succeed.
