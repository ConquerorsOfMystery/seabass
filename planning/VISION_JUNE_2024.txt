WHAT IS THE GOAL/DIRECTION OF SEABASS?
To make the ultimate programming tool. The first of the last
programming languages.

It first compiles to C (so it can be a viable low-level development
language) and then- the world!

A visual/graphical version of seabass should exist. How to make
parsehooks work with it is a good question.
