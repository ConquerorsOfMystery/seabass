A COHERENT VISION?

AST Designer + cgrdparser form "low level langdev tools" i.e. level 1

?? forms level 2

?? forms level 3...

Stack technology. Write higher level language designers in terms of lower level
ones.

Thus, with cgrdparser and the AST designer toolkit I should be aiming to write a
"low level toolkit" for higher level tools to "work in" or "work with" rather than
a user-level solution.

This incremental development process should be superior in terms of development resource
usage, although the final product is likely to be somewhat less efficient.

... So compiletimes are slightly longer. 

Maybe I'll regret that at some point but for now I think I can live with that. After
all, it's all building up to having a language implemented as a builder and not part of
what happens "every time a piece of DSL code is handled".
