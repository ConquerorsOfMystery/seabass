THE PLAN...

1. Set up test-benches, a "base-level interface" for my programs. I believe funbas is
sufficient. Some code might require interfacing more with C.

2. Write a bunch of programs. Demos, small utility programs, etcetera. Get a bunch of
example programs written in seabass to examine for useful programming constructs.

Types of programs I could probably write:
* Cellular automata
* RPG game
* Puzzle game
* Small games in general...
* Sorting algorithm visualization
* Fluid simulation
* Math visualizations
* Drawing/paint tools
* Network communication
* File utilities
* Unix utilities

I may also just find a bunch of small demos and examine them. I need to look at typical
examples of computer programming.

3. Study the software

4. Derive constructs

5. Use them in demos (I.e. write demos)

6. Encode them into stdmeta

7. Show the world! Make youtube videos.
