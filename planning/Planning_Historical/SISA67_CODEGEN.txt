I NEED TO WRITE A SISA67 CODE GENERATOR.

In order to do it _properly_ I need a sort of
"directive language"- a higher level generator
language which sits inbetween Seabass and S67.

The main advantage of this, of course, is that
I can do stuff like merge dispatch tables,
remove duplicate values, etcetera.

I want it to be a flat IR which means I need
to traverse the entire function node and
emit this IR for all the branches/leaves.

That should give me enough flexibility to
implement what I want.
