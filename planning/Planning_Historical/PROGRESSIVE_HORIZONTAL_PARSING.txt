It should be possible, using the NRAS, to perform a total
transformation from a sequence of tokens to an AST by progressively
generating interpretations based on the initial relationship (placement
in the text file) between tokens.

Inferences can be drawn locally, deriving intermediate concepts
until it finally reaches a finished state.
