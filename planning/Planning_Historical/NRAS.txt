THE NETWORKED REASONING AUTOMATA SOLVER

Property propagation on a network of nodes with relationships
and positions in those relationships, according to rules, is
a specialized case of a Networked Reasoning Automata.

More generally, you can have arbitrary automata which operate
on the network, storing their own state, possibly creating
new nodes and relationships, as well as modifying existing
ones.

NRAs can keep track of properties per node (thereby doing
property propagation).

NRAs can also create new NRAS systems, thereby allowing
recursion of NRAS.

This fully replaces and supersedes the NRS, FNRS, and VFNRS
system.

Now, how do I template these systems? (This will come after ASTbuilder)
