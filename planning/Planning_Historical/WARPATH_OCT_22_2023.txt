THE ROUTE OF CONQUEST LAYS BEFORE ME.

I must be careful to remember God in all my

help me in these matters, but not in anger,
lest I be brought to nothing. Amen.

THE UNRAS IMPLEMENTATION IS ALMOST COMPLETED.

Wow!

However, I need to plan out what the next steps are, and how I get there.

I feel... lost. Lacking direction.

I've just made a bunch of big changes to Seabass's base level syntax.

THE UNRAS NEEDS UTILITY FUNCTIONS FOR PATTERN MATCHING RELATIONSHIPS
once I have the ability to match linkage patterns (coord 15 connects to a coord 3)
then it'll be possible to write inferencing rules in terms of
those pattern matches.

this will be the powerhouse of the UNRAS system for universal computation.

... and it is pretty much finished. Wow. 

HOWEVER!

I would like to implement more functions to do pattern matching. For instance,
I need to be able to access a link which is a vector of children, and push
onto it.

That's done too!

Now, I need to write tests of the UAST and its methods.

I need to come up with a way to write 

1. TEST THE UNRAS

The UNRAS needs to be tested. Unit tests of the methods.

2. DEVISE A SCHEME FOR WRITING UNRAS RULES

I need to figure out how it is i'm going to write extremely ambiguous
grammars.
