NETWORKED REASONING SOLVER

By propagating properties through a set of
nodes (on a node to itself, or on a node
to other nodes with some set of properties)
I can model reasoning.

At the property level, there are constraints
    (Properties contradict)
    as well as propagation rules
    (Properties X,Y, and Z imply W)
    
After considerable thought, property propagation
and constraint resolution are algorithms executed
on a network (notable subclass: tree) and not
specific to parsing.

I need to write data structure templates for CBAS,
so that I can write NRS algorithms generically, so
that I can write an NRS language, and then implement
it as part of a wider "Language designer".

Thus, this is deferred until I have data structure
templating in CBAS.
