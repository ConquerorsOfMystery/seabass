What if you wanted the same struct to be both
a linked list and a vector at the same time?

It would have a right pointer and a data pointer.

You can push onto a vector or push onto the linked list.

if you do myStruct:push(3) (vec_int and linkedlist_int) what happens?

1. choose a default- the vector is faster

2. let the implementer pick- more tedious

3. error undefined, there's push_vec and push_ll

4. Problem for a higher level language.
