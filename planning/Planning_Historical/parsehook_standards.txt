PARSEHOOKS REQUIRE SOME DEGREE OF STANDARDIZATION.

If you have nested parsehooks, is it safe to manipulate
the code passed to the parsehook invocation just as much
as the code around it?

Do parsehooks passed into parsehooks have to be expanded for
further processing before the parent parsehook can do its work?


IT IS NOT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT YOU CAN MANIPULATE STUFF INSIDE
    OF A PARSEHOOK (in the general case)
    
    Any code passed into a parsehook belongs to _that_ parsehook, not
    the parent. It is not safe to assume in the general case that a parsehook
    may "mess with" the internals of another.
    
    For parsehooks like `cgrdparse` which purely wrap a subset of seabass while also
    providing its own extensions, it is fairly safe to assume that nothing inside the
    parsehook will become an interference-- however even then, an escape ($) was needed.
    
    The $ escape pattern seems like a fairly robust solution to this problem for
    seabass parsehooks- if something breaks, escape it with dollar signs.
    
    For the more general case, I think we can have parsehooks specific to a sub-language.
    
    If a particular syntax wants to have parsehooks inside of it, it can, in the general
    case, implement its own parsehook system which provides access to the token
    stream passed to that syntax.
