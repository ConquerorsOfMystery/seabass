CONCEPT MODELLING LANGUAGE

Similar to my idea for the EAG, but far more general purpose.

works by defining nouns and relationships, and transformations of
nouns and relationships into final token sequences.

You define nouns, verbs, and etcetera with grave statements.


//new, good idea

`new noun object.
`noun object has relationships [
    ismemberof aliases [has]
    ispropertyof
].


//old, bad idea
`define object [
    struct name
        structmodifiers
        structmembers
    end
] with info [
    `structmodifiers is a list of structmodifier.
    `structmembers is a list of structmember.
    `name is an identifier. //'is a' and 'is an' are equivalent.
    `exists no type with name name. // exists ?no? 
].
