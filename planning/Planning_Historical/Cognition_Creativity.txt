OUR CREATIVE IDEAS ARE REAL, BUT POORLY STRUCTURED.

They are, often, poorly understood. We have vague notions
and ephemeral ghosts of what we want to make, however
we often don't have everything hammered out.

This is true both in art and engineering.

The simpler an idea is, the less "ghosty" it is.

There are multiple strategies, then, for enabling greater
creative output:

1. Come up with ways that tools can work "in terms of"
    the ephemeral ghosts of our creativity.
    
    Make computers understand our creative notions.
    
    This seems almost impossible, as, for one thing,
    creativity is all about making _new_ ghosts...
    
2. Creating templates / frameworks for common ghosts and
    patterns among ghosts (which are themselves ghosts).
    
    Common ideas can be templated and given tweakable
    parameters to allow a person to express themselves
    in those tweakables.
    
    This is actually what any implementation of 1 would
    decay into (along with the ability to define new 
    ghosts).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following goals are logically derived from my model of cognition:

1. Make groking new patterns/ideas fast. Represent them in as many
    ways as possible, approached from multiple angles. Make this process
    easy and natural.
    
2. Make tools that allow creativity to be expressed in multiple
    ways, quickly and easily.
