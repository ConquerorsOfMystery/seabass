HOW DO YOU RETARGET CODE IN SEABASS?

1. #__CBAS_TARGET_WORDSZ, __CBAS_TARGET_MAX_FLOAT, __CBAS_TARGET_DISABLE_FLOAT

    You can set the word size and float size used when doing expressions.
    
    `uptr` in CBAS itself is affected by this choice.
    
2. #define TGT_UMAX, TGT_IMAX, TGT_FMAX...

    You can write macros that alias the system's unsigned and signed integer max types, as well as float max.
