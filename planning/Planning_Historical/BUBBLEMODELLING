BUBBLE MODELLING- A 3D MODELLING IDEA

You could do 3d modelling much more easily if you could
outline the rough shape of your object using bubbles and
boxes first, then "skin" the bubbles/boxes (generating a
triangle mesh).

You could even do stuff like specify how much each bubble, or
vertex of a box was "puffy" and etc to modify how the skin was
generated.

You could use small bubbles/boxes to make tiny details.

Boxes would likely be easier to implement.
