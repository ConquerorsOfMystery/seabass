SME WILL BE TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN SEABASS

but, well... it doesn't exist yet. I could begin work now,
but seabass is incomplete and I need it to make the work on SME
easier.

I need to design the high level language (I'm thinking a straight
redo of C, but with the metaprogramming operator).


Here is my vision for taking Cbas and using it to make SME:

1. Write a parser generator in Cbas which generates target code.

    This basically just means taking `cgrdparse` and reworking it
    into something for the target instead of codegen.
    
2. Write a converter for Cbas code to turn it into C.

    Everything in Cbas maps totally to C, so this should be easy. The hard
    part will be formatting the text output so that lines aren't ugly.
    
3. Design the new high level language in CBAS using my metaprogramming tools.

4. Design the assembler for the P-code.

5. Export both to C

6. Put them into the SME project in the repository.
