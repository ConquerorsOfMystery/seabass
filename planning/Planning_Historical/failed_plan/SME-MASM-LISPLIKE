1. COMBOS ALWAYS MAP TO REGISTERS (PCODE)

2. FUNCTIONS USE SHARED VARIABLES AT THE MASM LEVEL

    any function call using () can be translated into [] syntax easily.

3. FUNCTION POINTER ACCESS REQUIRES ABSENCE OF BRACKETS

    because the shared variable calling syntax uses [].
    
    For the sanctity of syntax readability, I should probably preserve the `getfnptr` system.

4. FUNCTIONS CAN BE INLINED JUST BY OFFSETING REGISTER REFERENCES.

    instead of register 0, you access register 12.
    
5. WE CAN AVOID USING POINTERS FOR METHODS JUST BY USING PASS-BY-VALUE.

    Combo mapping is done.
    


HOW DOES MYTYPE.MYMETHOD WORK IF TYPES ARE ANONYMOUS AND DUCK-TYPED?

    > we can preserve typedecl names through the name property of the sme_type
    > struct, and use that to search for mytype__mtd__mymethod
    > we check to see if the type is a member of the shared variable list.
        >Violates my principles...
    >...Hash it?
    >...come up with a scheme for generations unique names for types?
    
    [r32 r32] -> _combo_c_r32_r32_C_
    
    [r32 [r32 r32]] -> _combo_c_r32_c_r32_r32_C_C_
    
    BAM! Problem solved!
