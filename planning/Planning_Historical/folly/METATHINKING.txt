THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE SEABASS PROJECT- METATHINKING.

Enable people to quickly visualize, try, and model ideas in
the ways which are meaningful and useful to that person.

This shall help not only an individual thinker examine and build on
his own thoughts and ideas, but also the conveyance of ideas 
between people. All you have to do is quickly make a model or
representation of it in software- which the tools themselves will
help you do as part of its function.

It will also advance education- people will learn the tools from
a young age (Because they'll be like video games, except you can
decide all the rules yourself) and advance in their own intellectual
abilities.

This vision, if achieved, will send man skyrocketing into a new
age of super-intellectualism. The "groking" of new ideas and 
implementation of new models will become so fast that the world
will totally turn over every ten years.

The tools will be used to sharpen themselves, becoming ever more
powerful, until eventually, they become perfect representations of
man's innate reasoning abilities.

These tools will become the stuff of legend and the super-weapon of
ages,

THE TOOLS OF KAGRENAC

for the advancement of man's plight in the age of sin, for the vanquishing
of man's problems in a fallen world, for the conquest of the mysteries,
for the attainment of the treasures the Lord our God has buried for us
in the murky depths of abstract thinking and super-logical reasoning,

LET THE TOOLS BE MADE!

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who is Lord and God, who is,
and who was, and who is to come, the blessed one, the Son of God, the
Holy One of Israel, the mightiest of the mighty, the keeper of the keys
of death and hell, The first and the last, let the tools be made!

Let the tools be made!
