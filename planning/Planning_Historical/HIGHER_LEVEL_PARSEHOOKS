THE PROBLEM:

If I write a new language on top of seabass, how can I use parsehooks from the vanilla language in them?

THE SOLUTION:


1. record what token is at the start of the token stream.
2. Push a dummy token on which is invalid in seabass, or perhaps some closing square brackets.
3. Push everything after the parsehook invocation (@myparsehook ...) onto the token stream.
4. call the parsehook
5. Pull everything off the token stream from before the dummy token.
6. eat the dummy token
7. back to business!
