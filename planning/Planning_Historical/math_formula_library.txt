TO AID IN THE CONQUEST OF MYSTERIES?

there should be a library of "common math formulas" which
are encoded as inline functions.

This library will use plaintext names and have documentation
for the functions explaining what they mean and do.

For instance, angular momentum should be a math formula in
the library.

This will mean that people can use and "play with" math formulas
without having to understand weird greek symbols and all sorts
of jargon.

One of the things I should do when I get Seabass hooked up to
a GUI is create visualizations for lots of these functions
to make understanding them easier...
