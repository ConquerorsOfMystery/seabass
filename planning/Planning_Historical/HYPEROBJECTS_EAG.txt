THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME WITH THE IDEA OF THE HYPEROBJECT...

The metaprogramming abstraction to dominate them all.

WHAT ARE HYPEROBJECTS?

Compiletime data structures representing abstract
control flow, data types, and parsehooks.

The "elephant" would be an example of a hyperobject
in that it exists inside of a context (a scope) and
inserts new statements into the control flow to achieve
its "memory" effect.

CONTEXTS

A list of hyperobjects, and nested contexts.

Hypertypes are potentially also part of a context
but I see that as part of the "global context".

HOW DO HYPEROBJECTS PERFORM MANIPULATIONS OF THE
CONTEXT?

Thruogh Seabass codegen code. Hypertypes must be
implemented in Seabass to be usable. This means
that defining a hypertype requires a hard context
transition/nest (I.e. a context that requires 
its own validation separate from the parent context).

HOW DO CONTEXTS DECAY INTO CODE?

Hyperobjects must implement some sort of method
to generate a token list. This token list _is_
the "compiled" hyperobject.

HOW CAN A HYPEROBJECT DEFINE ITS OWN TYPE?

A hyperobject can be of a "metatype" which then
transforms the original hyperobject such that it
now has a new type.

WHAT IS THE SYNTAX OF THE EAG?

You can write expressions and/or statements which 
use hyperobjects. These expressions either cause
hyperobjects to call methods on the context or
methods on the expressions, or on themselves or
other hyperobjects.

Hyperobjects are basically able to transform the
structure of the EAG unit.
