1. MENTAL FLUX

    The mind's comprehension is best utilized when it is exercised from
    multiple different directions. Different angles, different uses,
    different pattern matching scenarios.
    
    Explaining things forces retrieval to occur as well as transformation
    (from thoughts into words).
    

2. TRANSFORMATION / PROBLEM TRANSLATION

    Primitive Tools limit us by forcing us to think "their way".
    
    What we need are tools that can be adapted to any way of thinking
    quickly.
    
3. SKELETONING AND TWEAKING

    The process of skeletoning something and then filling
    in the details seems to be parallel of the fleshing out of
    a fuzzy concept into a detailed one.
    
    A rough shape is seen, then details and proportions are tweaked
    according to observation and reality (logic) until finally
    the form is finished.
    
    This process, to me, seems like a universal archetype of
    the process of groking / understanding.
