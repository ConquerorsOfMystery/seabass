Seabass itself will make a powerful addition to the programmer's toolbox.

However, to truly reach the pinnacle of programming ease, the interface used must be overhauled.

GOALS

* Maximize the ability of the programmer to make meaningful input to the computer with minimal effort.
* Be compatible with existing HID hardware (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen)
* Make code easy to visualize
* Use audio-visual cues and elements to increase usefulness

IDEAS
* "Right click -> explain" - view docs on clicked-on thing
	* hover might also work
* Green box in Editor Plan 1.png
	* On hover over text (in code area)- display documentation
		> "What is this?" 
		> Don't obscure text
* Settings
	* Set expertise level or knowledge
		* ? Configured per programming language / template?
	* Where/how are preferences saved?
		* Per language and per template
		* Per project
		* Don't make the user figure out where .config is
		* Editor can edit your configs file
			* Do we store settings for that too?
