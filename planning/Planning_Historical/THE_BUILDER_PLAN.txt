THE BUILDER: THE ULTIMATE METAPROGRAMMING TOOL

Usage:

@bld new LoopBuilder {
	//the function prototype looks like this:
	//fn codegen cbas__bld__LoopBuilder(cgstrll* in)->cgstrll*

	return generate_loop_based_on_criteria(in);
}

@bld LoopBuilder [
	iterations 12
	start 0
	step 1
	var i
	body {
		char[50] buf;
		__builtin_itoa(buf, i*2);
		__builtin_puts(buf);
	}
	//anything you want passed into the builder...
]


The use demonstrated is obviously pathetic, but really
what you'd use this for is generating things like data structures
and perhaps even whole programs.

The kind of metaprogramming I actually want to do would probably involve writing
specific kinds of builders (I cannot recall at the moment), often generating other builders
in the process.

THE BUILDER IS THE GOLDEN KEY TO SOLVING METAPROGRAMMING.
