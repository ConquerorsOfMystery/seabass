Problem:
The metaprogramming library is expensive to rebuild.

I want to come up with some way to emit it as finalized code.

Solution:
Write a codegen_main which turns the metaprogramming library's
AST back into seabass code.

This can be used to "bake" (compile) code that doesn't need to be
modified.

If it does need to be modified, we just re-bake (recompile) it.
