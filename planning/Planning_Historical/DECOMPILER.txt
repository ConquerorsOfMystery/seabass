Code can be divided into linear blocks and nonlinear blocks.

Nonlinear blocks contain a branch at the end.

Linear blocks are comprised entirely of a linear sequence of instructions.

Linear blocks, by virtue of containing a function call, may still have
branching in them, in which case inlining should be done and the block should
be divided.

(how to keep track of what blocks come from where?)
