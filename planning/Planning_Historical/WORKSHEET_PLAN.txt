THE WORKSHEET- NAMED OR ANONYMOUS FIELDS

this is what the interface will look like:


@wksht[
	ifwksht //name of the worksheet

	//pick named or anonymous.
	//if you do not include this,
	//it will default to named.
	named
	//write code to be formatted
	[
		if( arg1 )
			body
		end
	]
	//list what identifiers (and keywords and operators) to replace.
	//you can't replace square brackets, obviously.
	arg1 [1]
	body [;]
]

@wksht[
	ifwksht_anon //name of the worksheet
	anonymous
	[
		if( arg1 )
			body
		end
	]
	arg1 [1]
	body [;]
]



@ifwksht [
	//for named, give a field name and then its definition
	arg1 [(1+1)==2]
	body [
		puts("What an unbelievable fact!!!");
	]
]


//if this were an anonymous worksheet...

@ifwksht_anon [
	[(1+1) == 2]
	[puts("What an unbelievable fact!!!");]
]
