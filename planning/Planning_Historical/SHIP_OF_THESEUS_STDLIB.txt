I can use the metaprogramming library to rewrite
parts of itself when the time comes by using dummy
labels.

I can even write comments by using string literal lines,

"this is a comment";

they'd be optimized out anyway, might as well emit them as comments!

I COULD, PERHAPS, WRITE THE ENTIRE TOOLCHAIN IN ITSELF, MAYBE
EVEN TEMPLATE IT, AND THEN EXPORT IT TO C CODE.

That'd be awesome, wouldn't it?
