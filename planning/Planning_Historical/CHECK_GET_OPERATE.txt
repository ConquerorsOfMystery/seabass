It is an extremely common pattern in code that you
want to check if something exists, and if it does,
you want to do something on it. If it doesn't
exist, you want to emit an error.

[get a from myvec[57]] => [action();][fail();]

[get a from *myptr] => [action();][fail();]

If "a" cannot be "gotten" then we do fail.

This is a safe way to prevent memory errors.
