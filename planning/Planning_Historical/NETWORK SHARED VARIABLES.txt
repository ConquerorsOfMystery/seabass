SEABASS NEEDS A NETWORKING-ORIENTED LANGUAGE.

I want to write a networking-oriented language
for seabass. I might make it an extension of
cbas++ or tarnish. main features:

* Networked shared variables. You will be able to define
  variables that are automatically synchronized between
  a client and a server (variables can be owned by the
  other side or by you).
  
* Automatic handling of the main connection loop. The
  language should have a built-in system for creating
  (or managing) the connection management loop where
  you receive packets from the other side and send
  packets to their side. This wil allow you to write
  networking programs much more easily.
