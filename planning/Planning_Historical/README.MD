# A reminder

Without the LORD, I am less than nothing. If I fail to acknowledge him as my creator, the blessed and holy one,

I risk painful abasement like happened to Nebuchadnezzar.

The cessation of blessings upon this project would spell its death extremely quickly.

Therefore, I dedicate this work to the one who is truly responsible for any success it actually has:

Jesus Christ of Nazareth

The Son of God, declared to be so by the power of the resurrection.

I am not particularly wise or intelligent. This project succeeds only if God puts it into my hand to succeed.

All material I have written should be viewed through this lens.

Because I fear God, I pray that he will not abase me or this work, but bless it, and multiply it,
and make it bear fruit abundantly, and serve him. To put it into my hand to make the most powerful
creative tool the children of men have ever made.

Let it be known that I deserve no credit or glory.

# Plans for seabass programming language and project

This directory contains my planning material for the direction of SEABASS.

Some of it is outdated or irrelevant, but it is preserved in case you should desire
to examine my thought processes.

Yes. I truly believe that Seabass (and its derivatives) are the future of programming.

Yes, I really do believe that man as a whole will have significant tangible benefits
springing forth from my work.

Whether this is my own delusion or true vision has yet to be determined. However, from
listening to Bjarne Stroustrup talk, I believe I have confirmed that I am correct:

Stroustrup wrote C++ because he noticed that Simula's higher level abstractions and syntax
not only enabled him to more succintly express his thoughts, but helped him catch errors in
his own reasoning.

Stroustrup wanted to design a language with abstractions that did the same thing, but base it
on C.

The result is the most powerful language currently in production (that I know). C++ is the
juggernaut of powerful languages, with only a few close contenders (Rust being one of them).

I am making a language designed to let programmers write their own abstractions arbitrarily, letting
them make advancements like Stroustrup did *on their own*.

Stroustrup thought my thoughts coming up with SEABASS, but didn't take the extra step that I'm taking.

Every programmer can make a leap in the efficiency and effectiveness of their work like C++ did for C.

His lecture, to me, vindicates and proves that this vision is correct- Arbitrary metaprogramming abstraction
is the future. The first of the last programming languages, the beginning of the end for software development.
