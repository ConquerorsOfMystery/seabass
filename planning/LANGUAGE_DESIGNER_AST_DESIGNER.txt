HOW DO I LAY OUT AN AST?

Structs are already pretty good. I could just use that
however, the hard part is writing the AST traversal.

What if I wrote a language specifically for writing the code
that is usually part of traversing and manipulating ASTs?

Good idea?

THE AST DESIGNER LANGUAGE

first, you lay out all the structs you want in your AST.

second, you make "visitation" functions for your nodes, i.e. "what do
I do if I visit this node"

third, on your final AST, you call the visitation function on the root node(s).
