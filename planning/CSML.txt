CODE STRUCTURE MODELLING LANGUAGE

Build a language where you can define words. Words may have multiple functions, they may
modify one or more other words, etcetera.

Instead of writing code entirely imperatively, you give the computer understanding of the
structure of your architecture first, and then *in the context of that architecture* you
write imperative code.
