WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF METAPROGRAMMING THEORY?
To create abstractions which are good "building blocks"
or "tools" for software infrastructure.

To create languages which form fluid spaces for thought about
how to write code.

HOW DOES CBAS ENABLE METAPROGRAMMING?

The Parsehook. Codegen code. You can extend the compiler.

WHAT BASIC PRINCIPLES IN METAPROGRAMMING THEORY ARE IMPORTANT?

* Contextual inference. By establishing a "context" within the
structure of the code, it is possible to make the language more
suitable for that specific case. One way to have a context for
instance is to have "[a] thing(s) you are talking about". Obvious
example is how methods can speak of the object they were called
on as "this".

* Concept modelling. Nouns, adjectives, and verbs can have relationships
between each other which describe software's structure, most obviously
control flow, namespaces, and data hierarchies (Class members). Ordinary
C does not do very much of this- it really only has the concept of "parent/child"
relationships. struct members, function arguments, statements inside of a
compound statement. C++ has the concept of a "friend class".

WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS FOR ABSTRACTIONS?

* The EAG. Extremely Ambiguous grammar. I currently envision
it as being a concept-modelling language, the data structure of which
is then parsed to generate "ordinary code".

* Symbol Knowledge System. For a given scope (global too) there may be
"attributes" for "nouns" in the code. These are useful for static analysis
and inferencing. Also great for "plugging" (making components talk to each
other automatically).

* CBAS++. An extension of CBAS which incorporates multithreading and other
factors into its linguistic structure.

WHAT NEW "HARD METAPROGRAMMING" STUFF DO I WANT TO ADD TO CBAS?
(i.e. advancing the theory of metaprogramming itself; scientifically
important)

>> The EAG. I want to create the EAG.

>> Demonstrations of the UAST's usage as a concept modelling tool.
This is "hard" because the data structure itself is not sufficient
to determine how to use it.

>> The Symbol Knowledge System.

SOFT METAPROGRAMMING STUFF?

>> Lots of templated stuff. Algorithms and stuff.

>> Some DSLs. I'm thinking particularly for algorithm specification,
especially on containers.

>> C++-esque stuff. We want iterators, for-each, etcetera implemented
in CBAS. Whether this is as simple as combining symbol knowledge with
worksheets and templates is a potshot.


MAKING CBAS A USEFUL TOOL?

>> I need a GUI library that can render text, checkboxes, sliders, and other
common widgets or widget components. Full truetype rendering would be awesome,
but, well, bro it's so many characters. How?!?!

I might just have to settle with ASCII extended only. Perhaps fonts can be specified.

(Doesn't work for things like arabic or japanese, but whatever, dude)

>> I need to make writing new backends easy.

>> I need to write DOCUMENTATION. Especially TUTORIALS, REFERENCE, GUIDES, AND EXPOSITORY
MATERIAL. 

DEMOING CBAS? PROVING IT TO THE WORLD?

I think it would be awesome to write my own "gui program engine" which I could compile
for windows. It would then accept scripts in javascript or lua or something to drive
it.

I could write a game engine, which could sell on steam.
