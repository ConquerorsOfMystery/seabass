CBAS IS A SUPERWEAPON WAITING TO BE ARMED.

"Completed" in its core function, but not ready to be used.

I want to start building CBAS into a true super-weapon-

I want to write a gui library (including ASCII font rendering)
using funbas. I want a practical 3d/2d rendering library
which uses software (No shaders).

I want algorithm implementations in CBAS- notably for software
rendering, I want everything needed to go from triangle models
and transforms to a "final result".
