CBAS IS A SUPERWEAPON WAITING TO BE ARMED.

"Completed" in its core function, but not ready to be used.

I want to start building CBAS into a true super-weapon-

I want to write a gui library (including ASCII font rendering)
using funbas. I want a practical 3d/2d rendering library
which uses software (No shaders).

I want algorithm implementations in CBAS- notably for software
rendering, I want everything needed to go from triangle models
and transforms to a "final result" all built-in and pre-packaged
for use.

I would also like to be able to access hardware rendering with
similar ease.

I could probably create my own shading language which can be compiled
to GLSL or whatnot


WHAT NEEDS TO BE MADE FOR CBAS TO BE "READY"?

1. Software rendering toolkit

2. GUI library

3. More metaprogramming tools and demos

4. Documentation

Development of CBAS and the TOOLS OF KAGRENAC project should continue after I have successfully
written more books for Amazon.
